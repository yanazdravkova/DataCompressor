# DataCompressor

Data Compression based on Huffman Algorithm 

Description of the project could be found [here](https://github.com/yanazdravkova/DataCompressor/blob/master/README.md)

The current repository contains the refactored Compression Part from [the Huffman Algorithm Project](https://github.com/yanazdravkova/Huffman-Algorithm)


Some possible improvements for the future:

* Print of Huffman tree in more beautiful format
* Refactoring the decompresseion part
* Unit tests
