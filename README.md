# DataCompressor

Data Compression based on Huffman Algorithm 

Description of the project could be found [here](https://github.com/yanazdravkova/DataCompressor/blob/master/description.pdf)

*** The Doxygen generated documentation of the project [here](https://github.com/yanazdravkova/DataCompressor/tree/master/DataCompressor/DocumentationDoxygenGenerated)

The current repository contains the refactored Compression Part from [the Huffman Algorithm Project](https://github.com/yanazdravkova/Huffman-Algorithm)


Some possible improvements for the future:

* Refactor the decompression part
* Print Huffman tree in a more beautiful format

*** ADDED Unit tests (catch framework used)
